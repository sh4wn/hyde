 Welcome to this second part in a series of articles about multithreading with C++11. 
In the previous part, I briefly explained what a thread is, and how to create one with the new C++ thread library. 
This time, we will be writing a lot more code, so open up your favourite IDE if you want to try the examples while you're reading.

In the previous article we also saw that sometimes, the output wasn't completely right when running multiple threads simultaneously. Today,
we'll see that there are some other problems with sharing a resource between threads, and of course, provide some solutions to these
problems.

Lost data
---------

Let's start with a simple example. Consider the following program:

~~~cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <thread>
#include <vector>

using std::thread;
using std::vector;
using std::cout;
using std::endl;

class Incrementer
{
	private:
		int counter;

	public:
		Incrementer() : counter{0} { };

		void operator()()
		{
			for(int i = 0; i < 100000; i++)
			{
				this->counter++;
			}
		}

		int getCounter() const
		{
			return this->counter;
		}		
};

int main()
{
	// Create the threads which will each do some counting
	vector<thread> threads;

	Incrementer counter;

	threads.push_back(thread(std::ref(counter)));
	threads.push_back(thread(std::ref(counter)));
	threads.push_back(thread(std::ref(counter)));

	for(auto &t : threads)
	{
		t.join();
	}

	cout << counter.getCounter() << endl;
	
	return 0;
}
~~~

The purpose of this program is to count to 300000. Some smartass programmer wanted to optimize the counting,
and created three threads, each adding 100000 times one to a shared variable `counter`. 

Let's walk a bit through the code. We create a new class called `Incrementer`, which holds a private variable
`counter`. The constructor is really simple, simply initializing `counter`, by setting it to zero. 

What follows is an operator overloading function, and in this case `operator()`. This means that each object of
this class, can be called as a simple function. Normally you would call a method on an object like this:
`object.fooMethod()`, but now, you can actually _call_ the object, like this: `object()`. This is convenient, because
now we can pass the whole object to the thread class, and within the operator overloading function, use all advantages
of a class. And the last method of the class is `getCounter`, a simple getter for the `counter` variable. 

Then, we have the `main()` function, here we create the threads in a similar manner as in the previous article. A few
differences though: we now create an object of the class `Incrementer`, and we pass it to the threads. Note that we use
`std::ref` here, to pass a reference of the object, instead of passing a copy to the thread.

So, let's see what this program produces, and if this smartass programmer is really smart. Compile the program using
GCC 4.7 or higher, or Clang 3.1 or higher. In case of GCC, use the following command:

`g++ -std=c++11 -lpthread -o threading_example main.cpp`

And voilÃ , the output:

~~~
[lucas@lucas-desktop src]$ ./threading_example 
218141
[lucas@lucas-desktop src]$ ./threading_example 
208079
[lucas@lucas-desktop src]$ ./threading_example 
100000
[lucas@lucas-desktop src]$ ./threading_example 
202426
[lucas@lucas-desktop src]$ ./threading_example 
172209
~~~

But wait a second! That smartass programmer wasn't so smart after all! The program doesn't count to 300000, one run
only reached the 100000! Why is this happening? Well, as simple as 'increment by one' sounds, it actually requires
multiple instructions for the processor to increment the right variable:

~~~gas
movl	counter(%rip), %eax
addl	$1, %eax
movl	%eax, counter(%rip)
~~~

What happens is this:

1. We have the current counter value stored in memory, and we load that value into the EAX register
2. We add one to the value in the EAX register
3. We store the value in EAX back in the original memory location

I hear you think: "Ok, nice information, but how does this solve my counting problem smartass?". Well, remember from 
the previous article, that threads shared the processor, if there's only one core. So at some point, one thread is
really happy because his instructions are executed for a while, but then comes the big boss operating system saying
"Ok, time's up, back in the line!", and then another thread will be executed for a while. And when it's the turn of the
original thread again, he starts executing where he was left. So, can you guess what happens, if the operating system
gives another thread the processor, while the original thread was in the middle of the process of incrementing the value
of a variable by one? Well, for example this:

<table>
<tr>
<th width="25%">Thread 1</th>
<th width="25%">Thread 2</th>
<th width="5%">Counter</th>
<th width="55%">Explanation</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>%eax <- counter</td>
<td>nothing</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>The current value of the counter is now stored in EAX</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>%eax + 1</td>
<td>nothing</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>The value in EAX is now 2, but the counter hasn't been updated yet</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>nothing</td>
<td>%eax <- counter</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>Hey, a switch to the other thread, and because the counter hasn't been updated, it loads the old value</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>%eax -> counter</td>
<td>nothing</td>
<td>2</td>
<td>And we're back at thread 1. When a thread switches, the state of the registers (for example EAX), are saved, and when we switch back, they're restored in their original state. Because EAX was two the last time thread one got interrupted, that value will be written in the counter variable.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>nothing</td>
<td>%eax + 1</td>
<td>2</td>
<td>And we're back at thread 2. The last time thread got interrupted, EAX had the value 1. </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>nothing</td>
<td>%eax -> counter</td>
<td>2</td>
<td>And because EAX was one (and is now two because of the previous instruction), the counter remains 2.</td>
</tr>
</table>

Hey it's occupied!
------------------

The solution is to make sure only one thread can access the shared variable at the same time. This can be done using the
[`std::mutex`][mutex] class. Visualize it as a sort of toilet: when you go inside, you lock it, do your stuff, and then you unlock it.
Anyone who wants to use the bathroom has to wait before you're ready. 

A convenient feature of a mutex is that operating system makes sure the operations locking and unlocking are indivisible. This means that the thread will not be
interupted when it's trying to lock or unlock a mutex. When a thread locks or unlocks a mutex, this operation will be finished
before the operating system switches threads.

And the best thing is, when you try to lock a mutex, but some other thread already locked it, you'll have to wait. But the operating
system keeps track which threads wait on which mutex. The blocked thread will go in a "blocked on _m_" state, meaning that the 
operating system won't give that thread any processortime any more, until the mutex becomes unlocked. This means no wasted
CPU cycles. If there are multiple threads waiting, it depends on the operating system which thread will be the 'winner'. 
General purpose operating systems like Linux and Windows use a First In First Out system, on realtime operating systems it's
priority based.

Let's modify above code, to make sure counting works as expected.

~~~cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <thread>
#include <vector>
#include <mutex>

using std::thread;
using std::vector;
using std::cout;
using std::endl;
using std::mutex;

class Incrementer
{
	private:
		int counter;
		mutex m;

	public:
		Incrementer() : counter{0} { };

		void operator()()
		{
			for(int i = 0; i < 100000; i++)
			{
				this->m.lock();
				this->counter++;
				this->m.unlock();
			}
		}

		int getCounter() const
		{
			return this->counter;
		}	
};

int main()
{
	// Create the threads which will each do some counting
	vector<thread> threads;

	Incrementer counter;

	threads.push_back(thread(std::ref(counter)));
	threads.push_back(thread(std::ref(counter)));
	threads.push_back(thread(std::ref(counter)));

	for(auto &t : threads)
	{
		t.join();
	}

	cout << counter.getCounter() << endl;
	
	return 0;
}
~~~

Note the changes: we included the `mutex` header file, added a member `m` to our class, with type [`mutex`][mutex], 
the standard mutex class in C++11. In the method `operator()()`, we lock the mutex just before incrementing
the counter, and afterwards we unlock it again. 

When we run the program, the output is correct:

~~~
[lucas@lucas-desktop src]$ ./threading_example 
300000
[lucas@lucas-desktop src]$ ./threading_example 
300000
~~~

And as always in computer science, there's no free lunch. Using mutexes will considerable slow down your
program, but that's better than an incorrect program.

Heimdall, guard us against exceptions
-------------------------------------

When incrementing a variable by one, the chance of an exception being raised it not really high, but with more
complex code, it's definitely possible. The above code is not really exception safe. When an exception
occurs, the mutex will still be locked, while the function is already finished. 

To make sure the mutex is unlocked when an exception is thrown, we could use the following code:

~~~cpp
for(int i = 0; i < 100000; i++)
{
	this->m.lock();
	try
	{
		this->counter++;
		this->m.unlock();
	}
	catch(...)
	{
		this->m.unlock();
		throw;
	}
}
~~~

But, that's an awful lot of code, for just locking and unlocking a mutex. Luckily, there's a nice simple
solution for that, the [`std::lock_guard`][lock_guard] class. The `lock_guard` class is really simple: it 
locks the given mutex on creation, and unlocks the mutex when the lock is destroyed (for example, at the
end of a function scope).

Modifying the above code again results in:

~~~cpp
void operator()()
{
	for(int i = 0; i < 100000; i++)
	{
		lock_guard<mutex> lock(this->m);

		// The lock has been created now, and immediatly locks the mutex
		this->counter++;

		// This is the end of the for-loop scope, and the lock will be
		// destroyed, and in the destructor of the lock, it will
		// unlock the mutex
	}
}
~~~

This code is also exception safe, because when an exception occurs, the destructor of the lock will still
be called, resulting in an unlocked mutex.

And remember, you can create your temporarily scopes in the following way:

~~~cpp
void long_function()
{
	// some long code

	// Just a pair of curly braces
	{
		// Temp scope, create lock
		lock_guard<mutex> lock(this->m);

		// do some stuff

		// Close the scope, so the guard will unlock the mutex
	}
}
~~~

I promised in the previous article to explain why the printing of "Hello World" and "Parallel World" 
sometimes went wrong. I hope you understand now that sharing resources between threads without
synchronization can cause problems. 

I'm going to be a bit lazy here, and redirect you guys [to this stackoverflow question][cout_thread]. To
fix the output of cout, just create another mutex, and each thread should lock that mutex before sending
something to cout, and of course unlock it when it's done.

I hope you enjoyed the article, and next time we'll cover condition variables, another widely used technique
to synchronize threads.
