# Welcome!

I am a PhD-candidate in bioinformatics at Delft University of Technology and my 
project is in close collaboration with the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, 
where I will be doing most of my work. My background is in electrical 
engineering and computer science, and I have gained a huge interest in biology 
the past few years. Now I am using my knowledge on algorithms, data structures 
and machine learning to help answer biological questions.

My research focusses on sequence variation graphs and its application to 
microbial pangenomics. I will develop novel algorithms and data structures to 
help identify and compare bacterial strains. This could aid in the analysis of 
bacterial populations (for example, in the human gut) and help understand how 
antibiotic resistance arises.
